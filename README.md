# Data Science & Toolkits

## Description

This repository is based on a lecture from the University of Lucerne in Applied Data Science.

Throughout the semester we were confronted with several exercises in the topic of data science and its toolkits, as well as architectures.

In this repository, we follow the exercises (called milestones) and show how we tried to solve them.

## Requirements

The following listings are the software we used and recommend using.

1. OS: Ubuntu 20.04

2. Python (version 3.8.3 recommendend)

2. Keras (version 2.4.3 recommended)

3. Tensorflow (version 2.3.1 recommmended)


## Code

We were given a data set and code, which act as our base to apply our exercise solutions on.
